It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### Heaven for copy-pasters\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with near everything in my favorite `zsh`. But I am worried every time when I need to copy a lot of different files from different parts of the disk.\r\n\r\nVery convenient way to do it using the copy-paste paradigm, like in Explorer or Finder. Simply select the files, press `ctrl+c`, switch to the directory you require, press `ctrl+v`.\r\n\r\nSo, I am worried and once upon a time I said: \"Enough\". And so was `C` born.\r\n\r\n### What is C?\r\n\r\n`C` is a small Python3 script which trying to imitate `ctrl` or `cmd` key for files operation. How it works? It's simply like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /etc\r\n$ c c passwd\r\n+. /etc/passwd\r\n$ c c sudoers sshd_config\r\n+. /etc/sudoers\r\n+. /etc/sshd_config\r\n$ cd apache2 \r\n$ c c httpd.conf\r\n+. /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\r\n$ cd ~/backup\r\n$ c v\r\nCopying to `/home/bobuk/backup'\r\n. /etc/sshd_config -> backup/sshd_config\r\n. /etc/passwd -> backup/passwd\r\n. /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -> backup/httpd.conf\r\n. /etc/sudoers -> backup/sudoers\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `c c` is a analogue for `ctrl+c` and `c v` for `ctrl+v`. Looks like a crap? Yes. But with nifty aliases it's can be a much easier. You can use your favorite `ctrl+commands` as a shell commands.\r\n","name":"C"}
