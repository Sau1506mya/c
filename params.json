{"body":"### Heaven for copy-pasters\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with near everything in my favorite `zsh`. But I am worried every time when I need to copy a lot of different files from different parts of the disk.\r\n\r\nVery convenient way to do it using the copy-paste paradigm, like in Explorer or Finder. Simply select the files, press `ctrl+c`, switch to the directory you require, press `ctrl+v`.\r\n\r\nSo, I am worried and once upon a time I said: \"Enough\". And so was `C` born.\r\n\r\n### What is C?\r\n\r\n`C` is a small Python3 script which trying to imitate `ctrl` or `cmd` key for files operation. How it works? It's simply like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ cd /etc\r\n$ c c passwd\r\n+. /etc/passwd\r\n$ c c sudoers sshd_config\r\n+. /etc/sudoers\r\n+. /etc/sshd_config\r\n$ cd apache2\r\n$ c c httpd.conf\r\n+. /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\r\n$ cd ~/backup\r\n$ c v\r\nCopying to `/home/bobuk/backup'\r\n. /etc/sshd_config -> backup/sshd_config\r\n. /etc/passwd -> backup/passwd\r\n. /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -> backup/httpd.conf\r\n. /etc/sudoers -> backup/sudoers\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `c c` is a analogue for `ctrl+c` and `c v` for `ctrl+v`. Looks like a crap? **Yes!** But with nifty aliases it's can be a much easier. You can use your favorite `ctrl+commands` as a shell commands.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ ls\r\nREADME.md   TODO.todo   c       install.sh\r\n$ cmd+c README.md install.sh\r\n+. README.md\r\n+. install.sh\r\n$ mkdir release && cd $_\r\n$ cmd+v\r\nCopying to `/Users/bobuk/V/c/release'\r\n. /Users/bobuk/V/c/README.md -> /Users/bobuk/V/c/release/README.md\r\n. /Users/bobuk/V/c/install.sh -> /Users/bobuk/V/c/release/install.sh\r\n$ ls -1\r\nREADME.md\r\ninstall.sh\r\n$ cmd+c\r\n+D /Users/bobuk/V/c/release\r\n$ cd ..\r\n$ cmd+del\r\nAre you sure to remove 1 directories files (y/n)y\r\nmove to trash /Users/bobuk/V/c/release\r\nDone\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case I use `cmd+commands` because installation script recognize what it run on Darwin.\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ cmd+h\r\nList of commands:\r\n    cmd+c mark files and directories for copying or moving\r\n    cmd+v copy files and other stuff to current directory\r\n    cmd+del remove selected files to trash\r\n    cmd+p show a list of marked files\r\n    cmd+R reset list of selection\r\n    cmd+h show list of commands\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nThis is a raw list of features. Must be reordered and completed.\r\n\r\n* `cmd+c` command work as 'mark files' and take unlimited number of arguments.\r\n* `cmd+c` with no arguments work as `cmd+c` with current directory argument.\r\n* `-q` switch make all commands quiet.\r\n* `-2` will stop commands from files list flushing. I.e. after `cmd+v` old files list still in buffer.\r\n* `cmd+del` remove files into system trashcan if module `send2trash` is installed.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nYes, it's me. All code and staff was writen by BoBuk.\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nIt's absolutely freeware and public domain.\r\nBut copying with bad intents prohibited by real patsans law\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
